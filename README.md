# Customer-Segmentation
E-commerce stores which became success stories were successful in targeting the desired customers. 
One of the techniques by which they were able to achieve this was customer segmentation i.e. by segmenting the existing customers based on RFM.
An RFM analysis evaluates clients and customers by scoring them in three categories: 
  1) How recently they've made a purchase - Recency
  2) How often they buy any product - Frequency
  3) How much money a customer spends on purchases - Monetary Value
